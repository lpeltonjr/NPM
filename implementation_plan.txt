Implementation:

1)  Study PCL6046 ASIC user manual and online sources for familiarity with motion controllers.
2)  Code communication routines for STM32 to control PCL6046.
3)  Create FreeRTOS superstructure for tasks specified in challenge description.
4)  Create the limit task using what ASIC user manual says about software limits and
    what seems reasonable, assuming:
    a)  user specifies a safe distance in pulse counts;
    b)  between any 2 carriers/axes, + limit on the left side and - limit on the right side
        must be calculated from the current positions of the carriers/axes and the safe distance to
        be maintained;
    c)  COUNTER1 of each axis is the source for the absolute position in pulse counts

-----X--------------Y--------------Z-------------U---------
X is COUNTER1 for X axis (leftmost object);
Y is COUNTER1 for Y axis;
Z is COUNTER1 for Z axis;
U is COUNTER1 for U axis (rightmost object)

(Y - X) >= safe distance
(Y - safe distance) is + limit for X
(X + safe distance) is - limit for Y

- limit for X and + limit for U will not be set, since I don't know the length of the track

5)  Create an extra task to light LED(s)
